feedback
- latea: 
	- negative reviews after testing this similar product (the leftover meals), interested in the coupons and discounts, 
	- need consumers to place themselves on the product (roughly 10k)
	- mentioned the happy hours on tuesday (bogo), happy hour: gaining visibility through freshman in the fall, wants to bring customers into the store physically (not through rso events), got traction from following on instagram, doesnt want to go through layers
	- wednesday is the next worst day to improve upon
	- using spreadsheets to import into the application could be easier through the POS system Infi, integrating API into our product, if using loyalty points not to use promotions and vice versa
	- quality control is a big issue
	- have a singular application to update, change supply count
- susuru ramen
	- toast pos system but using chowly for integration for the online systems
	- doesnt care about if the meals are going to be cheaper during the summer since they want to make a certain amount of sales
