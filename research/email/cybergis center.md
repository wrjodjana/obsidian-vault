Hello Professor Anand,

I came across your profile and understand you run the CyberGIS Center. I'm a current junior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Statistics and think I'd be a great fit technically. I'm currently looking for an hourly research assistant position for Summer or Fall 2025.

Over the last year, I've been working with the Uncertainty Quantification Group on a platform to predict bridge failures based on natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods. For the website, I built most of the frontend using TypeScript and React.js, while the backend uses Flask and PyTorch to integrate graph neural networks and analyze the structural requirements of bridges using the NBI and HAZUS datasets. Based on this experience, I believe I'd be a great fit to further help develop the CyberGIS Center projects which utilizes geospatial data and full-stack development. 

I've attached my resume to this email. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you, 
Warren Jodjana
