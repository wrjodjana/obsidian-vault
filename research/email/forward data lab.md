**Why do you want to participate in research?**

Coming from Indonesia, I've realized that research opportunities are often limited, especially for those in high school/undergraduate programs. While there's a strong emphasis for research in STEM, it's often not universally open and reserved to the most talented. 

**Do you have prior research experience? Describe it.**



**What is the most interesting/innovative project that you have done? Describe it.**
