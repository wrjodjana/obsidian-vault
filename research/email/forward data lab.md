**Why do you want to participate in research?**

Coming from Indonesia, I've realized that research opportunities are often limited, especially for those in high school/undergraduate programs. While there's a strong emphasis for research in STEM, it's often not universally open and reserved to the most talented. When I decided to come to the US to study computer science, I wanted to open up myself to these opportunities that didn't exist back home while being able to grow my skills and deepen my understanding of the subject. 

**Do you have prior research experience? Describe it.**

I previously worked on two research projects. The first being with the department of special education which was using data analysis to develop new intervention strategies for young adults with disabilities. Most of it was collecting data by sitting down through interviews, conducting data processing using R, then researching new ideas based on the processed data. It was definitely an interesting experience as I got sat through the entire pipeline from when the research starts until the end
