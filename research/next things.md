- gnns
- static traffic assignment
- connectivity
- the intersection of two edges is a node or a change of a road
- creating a highway graph
- FEMA flood maps
- mapping the bridge failure probability to link failure probability
- probability failrue of link failure would be 0%
- select box and choose manual to remove those links and nodes
- reproduce Tong's result with the failure probabilities
- override bridge probability failures

completed
- created a highway graph
- still trying to figure out how to restructure the graph neural network to be used for all possible scenarios

week 12
- automate one of these results where we test the gnn
