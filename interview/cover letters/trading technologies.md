personal summary:

Hi, I'm Warren and I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science and Statistics at UIUC. I previously interned at a startup on campus working on optimizing their backend platform using Node.js and REST APIs and increasing daily active users from 10 at the start of the summer to roughly 500. I have also been a part of two research groups, one focusing on building a tool that's helping transport engineers make better risk decisions and another using machine learning to analyze parts of an interview. I have experience working with Python (Flask and FastAPI), TypeScript and cloud services such as AWS S3 and EC2. My coursework has also equipped me with strong analytical skills and a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and statistical analysis, which I've applied to solve complex problems in both my internship and research projects. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to create efficient solutions and am eager to bring my technical knowledge and collaborative approach to a challenging role where I can continue to grow as a developer.
