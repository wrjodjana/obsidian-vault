personal summary:

Hi, I'm Warren and I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science and Statistics. I previously interned at a startup on campus working on optimizing their backend platform using Node.js and REST APIs and increasing daily active users from 10 at the start of the summer to roughly 500. I have also been a part of two research groups, one focusing on building a tool that's helping transport engineers make better risk decisions and another using machine learning to analyze parts of an interview. I have experience working with Python (Flask and FastAPI), TypeScript and cloud services such as AWS S3 and EC2.
