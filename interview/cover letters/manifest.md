**Why do you want to work at a startup?**

Last year I joined a startup under the iVenture Accelerator program at UIUC and learned a lot about the intricacies of being a founder and creating valuable products. However, the one thing that stood out most was the concept of "iteration." Being able to pivot and iterate on different ideas while still growing as a team creates this adrenaline rush and mindset where nothing is considered perfectly built. This approach completely contrasts with the academic perfectionism of chasing a 4.0 GPA. In startups, it's always about adapting to various scenarios and learning how to grow beyond initial difficulties. I want to continue cultivating this mindset where I can freely push code while constantly interchanging different ideas, embracing the uncertainty and rapid evolution that defines true innovation.
