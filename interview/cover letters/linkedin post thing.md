**what's something you're proud to have worked on?**

Back home in Indonesia, computer science education is often a privilege rather than a standard. With lack of support from schools, many people often have to self-teach through online resources or from personal connections. Seeing this vision, me and a couple friends decided to start Garuda Hacks, Indonesia's first ever offline hackathon focusing on connecting technology education to the underprivileged. At the beginning of the planning phase, we had a lot of success for the event, securing sponsors such as MLH, Cohere and AWS. However, almost about a month in we found ourselves lacking within the monetary sponsorships mainly due to Indonesia's tech industry downturn. This situation was particularly difficult for me as it was my first major leadership role, managing a team that included more experienced individuals. After much deliberation and brainstorming with my team, we arrived at an unconventional solution: expanding our sponsorship outreach beyond the tech sector. This decision required a significant pivot in our strategy and messaging, which was risky given the limited time. We implemented this decision by collaborating closely with the sponsorship team to craft compelling pitches for FMCG companies and venture capital firms.
