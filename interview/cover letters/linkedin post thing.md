**what's the most difficult thing you've ever worked on?**

The most difficult project I've ever worked on is my current research position, which focuses on commercializing a platform that helps transportation engineers make better decisions using graph neural networks. The primary challenge has been scaling the product from concept to implementation while handling most aspects singlehandedly - programming the website, cleaning datasets, designing wireframes, and conducting user interviews. My lack of experience in this industry required extensive reading of technical manuals, discovering relevant datasets, and understanding the limitations of existing solutions such as ArcGIS to determine the product's direction.

Despite these challenges, the experience has been extremely rewarding. I've learned a lot from what began as a small idea from my professor to now having full ownership and direction in building out the product. It's particularly gratifying that multiple civil engineering companies have expressed interest in what we're developing.




**what's something you're proud to have worked on?**

Back home in Indonesia, computer science education is often a privilege rather than a standard. With lack of support from schools, many people often have to self-teach through online resources or from personal connections. Seeing this vision, my friends and I decided to start Garuda Hacks, Indonesia's first ever offline hackathon focusing on connecting technology education to the underprivileged. At the beginning of the planning phase, we had a lot of success for the event, securing sponsors such as MLH, Cohere, and AWS. However, about a month before the event, we found ourselves lacking monetary sponsorships, mainly due to Indonesia's tech industry downturn. This situation was particularly difficult for me as it was my first major leadership role, managing a team that included more experienced individuals.

After much deliberation and brainstorming with my team, we arrived at an unconventional solution: expanding our sponsorship outreach beyond the tech sector. This decision required a significant pivot in our strategy and messaging, which was risky given the limited time. We implemented this decision by collaborating closely with the sponsorship team to craft compelling pitches for FMCG companies and venture capital firms. In the end, we ended up raising enough money and even more to save for the next iteration, and we had over 2,000 attendees joining from all over the country. I'm most proud of this moment due to both the grit and fast problem-solving from me and my team, two qualities that are important for any growing startup.
