## **About Us**
The future of transportation is electric, and our software solves the most critical emerging grid integration challenges to ensure that the impending energy transition is clean, equitable, and resilient. Our enterprise solutions help the grid absorb the coming electrification wave with ease. Utilizing modern, cloud-native platform architecture and robust systems optimization, WeaveGridâ€™s software is built from the ground up to tackle the most critical network challenges while meeting the stringent regulatory, security, and reliability requirements of the utility industry.

**Why WeaveGrid?**

From my research in the Uncertainty Quantification Group, I've developed a strong understanding in transportation risk management and decision systems, particularly analyzing how engineers navigate technological constraints under uncertainty. This background has equipped me with the quantitative foundation to understand grid integration challenges at a systems level. My current work building a platform that optimizes disaster response for transportation networks aligns perfectly with WeaveGrid's mission of creating resilient electric infrastructure. I'm eager to apply my experience in optimization algorithms and decision support systems to help WeaveGrid ensure the electrical grid can reliably support widespread EV adoption while maintaining equity and sustainability across communities.
