>[!question]
>Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window**_ **_substring_** _of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` _(**including duplicates**) is included in the window_. If there is no such substring, return _the empty string_ `""`.
>
>The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

**Initial Questions:**
- What happens when the length of `t` is greater then the length of `s`?

**Explanation**
- Optimal: Using sliding window approach by having one pointer
