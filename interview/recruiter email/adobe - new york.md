UIUC CS Junior interested in Software Engineering :)

Hello [INSERT NAME], 

I came across your profile and understand you recruit for talent at Adobe. I'm a current junior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Statistics and think I'd be a great fit technically. 

I completed a software engineering internship at TooTak last summer focusing on backend engineering with an interest in JavaScript and Python and just applied to the Tech@Tyson Intern position for Summer 2025 in New York.

My focus at TooTak has mainly been using Node.js to optimize backend performance and improve data management systems. I implemented optimized REST API endpoints which helped to significantly scale the application's user base and enhance security through integration of JWT authentication. Next, I also led a cost-saving initiative by migrating user data to MongoDB and media files to AWS S3, establishing automatic backup systems that eliminated maintenance overhead and delivered substantial annual savings for the company.

I've attached my resume to this email. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you, 
Warren Jodjana
