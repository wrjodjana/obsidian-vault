Hello [INSERT NAME],

I came across your profile and understand you recruit for talent at Salesforce. I'm a current junior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Statistics and think I'd be a great fit technically.

I completed a software engineering internship at TooTak last summer focusing on backend engineering with an interest in JavaScript and Flask and just applied to the Software Engineering Intern position for Summer of 2026.

My focus at TooTak has mainly been using Node.js  to optimize backend performance and improve data management systems. I implemented optimized REST API endpoints which helped to scale the application's daily active users by 10 to 500 and enhance security through integration of JWT authentication. Next, I also led a cost-saving initiative by migrating user data to MongoDB and media files to AWS S3, establishing automatic backup systems that eliminated maintenance overhead.

I've attached my resume, and think I'd be a great fit! Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you,

Warren Jodjana
