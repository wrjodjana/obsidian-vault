Hello Jaynee,

I came across your profile and understand you recruit talent for Alkira. I'm currently a junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Statistics, and I believe I would be a great technical fit for your team.

Last summer, I completed a software engineering internship at TooTak where I focused on JavaScript and Python development. I recently applied for the Software Engineer Intern position through the Kleiner Perkins website.

In addition to this internship, I have strong experience with frontend technologies, particularly React. I developed a website for my Indonesian society on campus (hosted at permiasuiuc.org), created a small flashcard web application, and am currently prototyping a platform to help transportation engineers better understand infrastructure vulnerabilities. My other projects are available at wrjodjana.vercel.app.

I've attached my resume for your review. I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you, 
Warren Jodjana
