Hello Jaynee,

I came across your profile and understand you recruit for talent at alkira. I'm a current junior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Statistics and think I'd be a great fit technically. 

I completed a software engineering internship at TooTak last summer focusing on skills such as JavaScript and Python and recently applied to the Software Engineer Intern position on the Kleiner Perkins website.

In addition to this internship, I have strong experience working with frontend technologies, specifically React. I previously worked on a website for my Indonesian society on campus which is hosted on permiasuiuc.org, a small flashcard web application and currently prototyping a platform to help transportation engineers understand infrastructure vulnerabilities better. My other projects are also available at wrjodjana.vercel.app.

I've attached my resume to this email. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you, 
Warren Jodjana
