Hello, Daisy

I came across your profile and understand you recruit for talent at Gen Digital. I'm a current junior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and think I'd be a great fit technically.

I completed a software engineering internship at ToTak last summer focusing on backend engineering with an interest in JavaScript and Python Flask
