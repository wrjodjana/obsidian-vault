Hello, Daisy

I came across your profile and understand you recruit for talent at Gen Digital. I'm a current junior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and think I'd be a great fit technically.

I completed a software engineering internship at TooTak last summer focusing on backend engineering with an interest in JavaScript and Flask and just applied to the Software Engineering Intern position for Summer of 2025.

My focus at TooTak has mainly been using Node.js and AWS S3 to optimize backend performance and improve data management systems. I implemented optimized REST API endpoints


I successfully reduced API response times by 35% by implementing optimized REST endpoints and integrating JWT authentication, which helped scale daily active users from 10 to 500. I also led a cost-saving initiative by migrating user data to MongoDB and media files to AWS S3, establishing automatic backup systems that eliminated maintenance overhead and saved the company $4.8K annually.
