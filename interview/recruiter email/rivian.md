Hello Steve,

I came across your profile and understand you recruit for talent at Rivian's Research Park team. I'm a current junior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Statistics and think I'd be a great fit technically.

Last summer, I completed a data engineering internship at Halodoc where I focused on developing data solutions with Python, and I've just applied to the Data Engineering Intern position for summer of 2025.

At Halodoc, I focused on optimizing data engineering processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. I engineered automated ETL data pipelines that processed 100K rows of pharmacy data daily, reducing manual workload for data consumer teams. I also architected a data archiving solution for non-partitioned MySQL tables using PySpark, which resulted in 30% faster query performance and a $2.5K reduction in the company's yearly AWS expenditures. These implementations significantly streamlined operations while delivering measurable cost savings.

I've attached my resume, and think I'd be a great fit! Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you,

Warren Jodjana
