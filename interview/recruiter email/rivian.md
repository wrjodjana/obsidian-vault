Hello Steve, 

I came across your profile and understand you recruit for talent at Rivian's Research Park team. I'm a current junior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Statistics and think I'd be a great fit technically. 

Last summer, I completed a data engineering internship at Halodoc where I focused on developing data solutions with Python, and I've just applied to the Data Engineering Intern position for summer of 2025. 

At Halodoc, I focused on optimizing data engineering processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. My work included architecting a data archiving solution for non-partitioned MySQL tables using PySpark, which resulted in 30% faster query performance and a $2.5K reduction in the company's yearly AWS expenditures. I also engineered automated data pipelines that processed large volumes of pharmacy data daily, significantly reducing manual workload for other teams while delivering measurable cost savings. 

I've attached my resume and think I'd be a great fit! Looking forward to hearing from you. 

Thank you, 
Warren Jodjana
