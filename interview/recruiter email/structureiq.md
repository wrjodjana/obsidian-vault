Hello Sir/Madam,

I came across your profile and understand you recruit for talent at StructureIQ's Research Park team. I'm a current junior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Statistics and think I'd be a great fit technically. 

Over the last year, I've been working with the Uncertainty Quantification Group on a platform to predict bridge failures based on natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods. For the website, I built most of the frontend using TypeScript and React.js while the backend is using Flask and PyTorch to integrate graph neural networks and analyzing the structural requirements of bridges using the NBI and HAZUS datasets. Based on this experience, I believe I'd be a great fit to develop the company's backend civil infrastructure monitoring service.

I've attached my resume and let me know if you need anymore information! Looking forward to hearing from you. 

Thank you, 
Warren Jodjana
