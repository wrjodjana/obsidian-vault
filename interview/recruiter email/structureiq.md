Hello Sir/Madam,

I came across your profile and understand you recruit for talent at StructureIQ's Research Park team. I'm a current junior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Statistics and think I'd be a great fit technically. 

Over the last year, I've been working with the Uncertainty Quantification Group on a website to predict highway bridge system probability failures using graph neural networks. For the website, I built most of the frontend using TypeScript and React.js while the backend is using Flask to integrate the neural networks and analyzing the structural requirements of the bridges using the NBI and HAZUS datasets. I think from this experience I'd be a great fit to develop the civil infrastructure monitoring service

I've attached my resume and think I'd be a great fit! Looking forward to hearing from you. 

Thank you, 
Warren Jodjana
