Hello Sir/Madam,

I came across your profile and understand you recruit talent for Here Technologies. I'm currently a junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Statistics, and I think I'd be a great technical fit.

Over the last year, I've been working with the Uncertainty Quantification Group on a platform to predict bridge failures based on natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods. For the website, I built most of the frontend using TypeScript and React.js, while the backend uses Flask and PyTorch to integrate graph neural networks and analyze the structural requirements of bridges using the NBI and HAZUS datasets. 

I've attached my resume. Please let me know if you need any more information! Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you, 
Warren Jodjana
