Hello Julia, 

I came across your profile and understand you recruit for talent at Country Financial's Research Park team. I'm a current junior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Statistics and think I'd be a great fit technically. 

I completed a software engineering internship at TooTak last summer focusing on backend engineering with an interest in JavaScript and Flask and just applied to the Software Engineering Intern position for Summer of 2025.

At Halodoc, I focused on optimizing data engineering processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs. My work included architecting a data archiving solution for non-partitioned MySQL tables using PySpark, which resulted in 30% faster query performance and a $2.5K reduction in the company's yearly AWS expenditures. I also engineered automated data pipelines that processed large volumes of pharmacy data daily, significantly reducing manual workload for other teams while delivering measurable cost savings. 

I've attached my resume and think I'd be a great fit! Looking forward to hearing from you. 

Thank you, 
Warren Jodjana
