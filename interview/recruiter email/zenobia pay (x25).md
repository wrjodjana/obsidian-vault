Hello Teddy and Ryan,

I'm Warren, currently a junior studying computer science and statistics at UIUC. I saw your launch video on YCombinator's LinkedIn page and was immediately interested in Zenobia Pay's approach to online payments. As someone originally from Indonesia, I see similarities between your solution and the digital payment transformation that's happening back home, where bank-based payments are taking over traditional credit cards.

I was wondering if you have any engineering positions available for this summer. I have experience working with full-stack technologies such as React, Flask, and Node.js, and have also done both startup and research work. Last summer, I joined the iVenture Accelerator program on campus with a startup called TooTak, where I helped develop their MVP, focusing on backend development by building out game management systems using the MVC architecture in JavaScript, MongoDB, and S3.

I've attached my resume to this email as well. Looking forward to hearing back!

Warren Jodjana
