Hello Teddy and Ryan,

I'm Warren, currently a junior studying computer science and statistics at UIUC. I saw your guys launch video on YCombinator's Linkedin page and was immediately interested by Zenobia Pay's approach to online payments. As someone originally from Indonesia, I see similarities between your solution and the digital payment transformation that's happening back home, where bank-based payments are taking over traditional credit cards.

I was just asking if you guys had any engineering positions at the moment for the summer. I have experiences working with full-stack technologies such as React, Flask and Node.js and have also done both startup and research work related. Last summer, I joined the iVenture Accelerator program under a nonprofit called TooTak where I helped to develop their MVP, focusing on backend development with building out the game management systems using the MVC architecture in JavaScript.
