Hello [Insert Name]

I came across your profile and understand you recruit for talent at Fortive. I'm a current junior at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Statistics and think I'd be a great fit technically. 

I completed a software engineering internship at TooTak last summer focusing on backend engineering with an interest in JavaScript and Python and recently applied to the Software Engineer Intern position for Summer and Fall 2025.

At TooTak, I created engaging Persian language learning modules that significantly increased student engagement. I built backend systems using Node.js and the MVC architecture, implementing RESTful APIs that improved platform performance and helped scale our user base considerably. My work with MongoDB for user data and AWS S3 for media storage created an efficient hybrid solution that saved the company thousands in annual storage costs while eliminating maintenance overhead.

I've attached my resume to this email. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you, 
Warren Jodjana
