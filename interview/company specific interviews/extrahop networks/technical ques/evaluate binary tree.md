>Consider a binary tree representing an expression, where each node is a string representing either a function ("add", "subtract", or "square") or a number ("1", "2", "1634", etc.). If the node is a function, its subtree(s) represent the argument(s). Write a function that evaluates the expression, and returns the result as a string.
>To start, assume that the tree will represent a valid expression.
