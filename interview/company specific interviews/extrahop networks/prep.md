why extrahop
- ExtraHop is innovating in cybersecurity by fundamentally disrupting the traditional fragmented approach to network security through their industry-first all-in-one sensor technology that consolidates NDR, network performance monitoring, intrusion detection, and full packet forensics into a single integrated platform. For example, their breakthrough all-in-one sensor launched in April 2025 eliminates the need for organizations to tap into each network segment multiple times to feed different legacy security tools, addressing the critical problem where most organizations deploy a patchwork of legacy solutions that create operational complexity and security blind spots.
- I'm interested in working with larger clients compared to the startups where I was heavily involved in consumer-facing roles, However, ExtraHop isn't so large that I wouldn't still face challenges and be able to tackle multiple problems (according to my referral)
- I have extensive experience working with data, particularly in developing pipelines and data aggregation, which directly relates to ExtraHop's core product that analyzes network traffic to identify threats and secure cloud investments
