behavioural questions + recruiter call

intro
- cs and statistics junior studying at uiuc
- Internship experiences at a startup doing backend engineering and a unicorn doing data engineering
- Also have some research experience mostly focus on doing ai/ml integration towards web platforms

why extrahop
- ExtraHop is innovating by fundamentally **reimagining how enterprises approach network security** through consolidation and advanced AI-driven analysis. For example, recently the company announced the all-in-one sensor that eliminates the need for consumers to feed different legacy security tools.

- Also interested because the company is solving problems in the cybersecurity at a large scale. I'm also constantly solving problems, for example in my previous research experience the platform that I was building basically was nonexistent and much of the data I had to go through extensive loops to find. I believe that Extrahop's mission and values align with mine, particularly going above and beyond to satisfy the customers challenges.
- I want to work with larger clients compared to my previous startup experience in consumer-facing roles. ExtraHop offers the right balance—it's large enough to work with substantial clients but not so large that I'd lose the opportunity to face interesting challenges and solve varied problems.
