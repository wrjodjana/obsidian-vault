why extrahop
- ExtraHop is innovating in cybersecurity by fundamentally **reimagining how enterprises approach network security** through consolidation and advanced AI-driven analysis. For example, recently the company announced the all-in-one sensor that eliminates the need for consumers to feed different legacy security tools.

- 
- I'm interested in working with larger clients compared to the startups where I was heavily involved in consumer-facing roles, However, ExtraHop isn't so large that I wouldn't still face challenges and be able to tackle multiple problems (according to my referral)
- I have extensive experience working with data, particularly in developing pipelines and data aggregation, which directly relates to ExtraHop's core product that analyzes network traffic to identify threats and secure cloud investments
