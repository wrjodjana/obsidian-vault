>Given an undirected graph with n nodes, count the number of connected component
>You will be given an integer n representing total number of nodes and an array of edges
>where `edges[i] = [x, y]` representing that node x and y are connected
>Return an integer representing the number of connected components within the graph
>
>Example 1:
>Input n = 4, edges = `[[0, 1],[1,2],[2,3]]`
>Output: 1
>All nodes connected, so there is only 1 component
>
>Example 2:
>Input n = 4, edges = `[[0,1],[2,3]]`
>Output: 2
>0 1 are connected, and 2 3 are connected, so 2 components
