why extrahop
- I'm interested in working with larger clients compared to the startups where I was heavily involved in customer-facing roles
- However, ExtraHop isn't so large that I wouldn't still face challenges and be able to tackle multiple problems (according to my referral)
- I have extensive experience working with data, particularly in developing pipelines and data aggregation, which directly relates to ExtraHop's core product that analyzes network traffic to identify threats and secure cloud investments
