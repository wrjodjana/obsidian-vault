Tell me about yourself
- junior at UIUC studying computer science and statistics
- previously did two internships, one was as a backend engineering at an edtech startup and the other was doing data engineering at a healthcare unicorn
- however, i think the work that most relates to this role is my research position where I helped to develop a full-stack webapp
