**Tell me about yourself**
- junior at UIUC studying computer science and statistics
- previously did two internships, one was as a backend engineering at an edtech startup and the other was doing data engineering at a healthcare unicorn

**Why StructureIQ**
- Firstly, with my research experience I have a strong background within the industry of this role, specifically to like structural and transportation engineering
