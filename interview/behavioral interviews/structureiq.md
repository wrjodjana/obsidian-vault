**Tell me about yourself**
- junior at UIUC studying computer science and statistics
- previously did two internships, one was as a backend engineering at an edtech startup and the other was doing data engineering at a healthcare unicorn
- however, i think the work that most relates to this role is my research position where I helped to develop a full-stack webapp integrate graph neural networks to predict bridge and link failure probabilities of networks from natural disasetrs like earthqukaes

**Why StructureIQ**
- Firstly, with my research experience I have a strong background within the industry of this role, specifically to like structural and transportation engineering
- Secondly, I have a brief background in artifical intelligence and I've wanted to even adapt this idea within my research role, so I think joining a company like StructureIQ I would expand more on these skills while also improving my current backend engineering sk
