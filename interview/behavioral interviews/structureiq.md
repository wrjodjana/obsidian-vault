**Tell me about yourself**
- junior at UIUC studying computer science and statistics
- previously did two internships, one was as a backend engineering at an edtech startup and the other was doing data engineering at a healthcare unicorn
- however, i think the work that most relates to this role is my research position where I helped to develop a full-stack webapp integrate graph neural networks to predict bridge and link failure probabilities of networks from natural disasters like earthqukaes

**Why StructureIQ**
- Firstly, with my research experience I have a strong background within the industry of this role, specifically to like structural and transportation engineering
- Secondly, I have a brief background in artificial intelligence, so I think joining a company like StructureIQ I would expand more on these skills while also improving my current backend engineering skills. On the IoT side it'd be something completely new.
- Finally, 

**Why this role?**
- In terms of technical understanding, I've previously worked with Python, Flask and mySQL before so I have a strong, in-depth knowledge of how these technologies interact with frontend and backend applications
- Also through my data engineering role, I also did some basic dashboard development using Metabase and Apache Spark (PySpark) (not necessarily developing) but I'd understand what sort of visualizations are needed
- Finally, I personally don't have any experience with InfluxDB, but I researched a bit on the kinds of data it stores which is like time series and because I have worked on other databases of specific kinds of data types like PostGIS I'd be able to adapt quickly.
