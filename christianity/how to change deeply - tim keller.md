Pre-Sermon Notes
- Rejoice that your names are already written in heaven and not of this world (don't be spiritually bipolar)
- When you become Christian, your name is inscribed into Jesus Christ and he's bearing that sin
- The only eyes whose opinion matters in all the universe finds you more precious then all the jewels beneath the Earth
- Unless you know this you will not have the emotional strength to admit the amount of sin in your life
- If the basis of your self-image is that your a morally good person, once there's data coming into you that threatens that self-image you'll be in denial

**Outline:**
 1. Only if you really understand who you are in him, will you be able to admit how much sin is in you (*Roman 7:18-20 I have the desire to do what's right but not the ability to carry out*)


**Point 1:**
- Sin is always crouching and appear less serious and smaller then what they really are
