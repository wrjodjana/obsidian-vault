**Psalm 88**
- One of the only psalm's other than 39 which doesn't end in a happy note
- In the end of the psalm, talks about his only friend being darkness, and ends on that
- Darkness is mentioned 3 times

**Outline:**
1. Darkness will last a long time for a believing Christian
2. No better place to learn about the grace of God than during dark times 
3. and be a person of greatness during these times
4. Darkness can be relativized

**Point 1:**
- The guy in the psalm is calling to God, praying to God for help as he's losing friends, imminent to death (*Do you work wonders for the dead?*)
- Outwardly, the man experiences darkness through the physical but inwardly he faces darkness  spiritually
- Feeling of abandonment, he feels God is rejecting him and not listening to him
- **TEACHING:** Even if you're a believing Christian, it doesn't mean life will get better for a LONG time
- However, it's a mercy and shows the realism of the Bible. The Bible shows that you can do everything right, but that doesn't mean it will get better.
- There is somebody WAY better than us and that's Christ and he didn't have a good life, tortured and killed. (*John 16: In this world you will have trouble*)
- If you're expectations are aligned with reality and you know the Bible isn't selling anything, you can face the troubles (half the pain is from the false expectations)

**Point 2:**
- Some parts of the prayer is more like an interrogation (*Is your faithfulness known in the land of destruction*), the man is saying to God "Answer me God".
- When we're in despair, like this man, we have tendency to exaggerate and be angry and read everything in our life through that moment instead of saying God in the past you've done many good things for me.
- Being extremely disrespectful, cross-examining God and saying *darkness is my closest friend*  means I'd rather have darkness than you
- Why is this prayer in the Bible?
	- Psalm 39 similar: Turn your face away from God before I get despair
	- The very fact that God put them in the Bible shows that God identifies with those of us who pray like that because God knows us when we're desperate but still is the God of grace.

**Point 3:**
- It's true that he's not doing things right for God, but the one thing we know is that he's still speaking out to God
- To some degree, we all come to God because we have a problem or an emptiness (we want something) and if we stay in that state we're full of self-centeredness
- Job was being angry and upset at God but he never turned away, he stayed with God even if he was never getting anything out of it he defeated Satan similar to this story
- When you go through darkness, but you don't feel God's there but you hold on anyways that shows that were not transactional but a person of endurance, strength, greatness and stable

**Point 4:**
