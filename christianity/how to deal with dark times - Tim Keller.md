**Psalm 88**
- One of the only psalm's other than 39 which doesn't end in a happy note
- In the end of the psalm, talks about his only friend being darkness, and ends on that
- Darkness is mentioned 3 times

**Outline:**
1. Darkness will last a long time for a believing Christian
2. No better place to learn about the grace of God than during dark times and have greatness during these times
3. Darkness can be relativized

**Point 1:**
- The guy in the psalm is calling to God, praying to God for help as he's losing friends, imminent to death ("Do you work wonders for the dead")
- Outwardly, the man experiences darkness through the physical but inwardly he faces darkness  spiritually
- Feeling of abandonment, he feels God is rejecting him and not listening to him
- **TEACHING:** Even if you're a believing Christian, it doesn't mean life will get better for a LONG time
- However, it's a mercy and shows the realism of the Bible. The Bible shows that you can do everyth
